  <b>For running the bot: </b>

    <li>Then just run npm run start</li>
  </ul>
</div>
<div>
  <h1>IMPORTANT</h1>
  <b>Be careful of these things:</b>
  <ul>
    <li>
      The script needs to be started with ```js and end with ``` like a normal
      discord script
    </li>
    <li>The script needs to define the function it runs</li>
    <li>
      The script needs to run the function. So if you define the function and
      not run it, it wont work
    </li>
    <li> The function needs to <b>return</b> something or else the bot wont get a message to send in the first place</li>
  </ul>
  <b> Thats all. I hope you like this!</b>
