# jsParsingDiscordBot

<h2>
  Hello! this is a js interpreting bot. However, I havent made a sandbox for it
  so its still prone to risk. For that reason, i introduced a temporary way to
  go around that. Ill add a sandbox with time so that everyone can use it!
</h2>

<div>
  <b>For running the bot: </b>
  <ul>
    <li>Atfirst, attach your token to the token variable</li>
    <li>Then just run npm run start</li>
  </ul>
</div>
<div>
  <h1>IMPORTANT</h1>
  <b>Be careful of these things:</b>
  <ul>
    <li>
      The script needs to be started with ```js and end with ``` like a normal
      discord script
    </li>
    <li>The script needs to define the function it runs</li>
    <li>
      The script needs to run the function. So if you define the function and
      not run it, it wont work
    </li>
    <li>
      The function needs to <b>return</b> something or else the bot wont get a
      message to send in the first place
    </li>
  </ul>
  <b> Thats all. I hope you like this!</b>
</div>
